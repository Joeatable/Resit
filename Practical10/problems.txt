Q: How has the difference in DALYs between China and the UK changed over time?

Line number in dalys.py: 65

Discussion: 
From the line plot and numerical difference, we observe that China consistently had higher DALYs than the UK. 
However, the gap between the two has decreased gradually over time. This trend may reflect improvements 
in healthcare access and disease prevention in China over the decades, especially after the early 2000s.
The array difference printed at the end of the script shows how the DALYs gap evolved year by year.
